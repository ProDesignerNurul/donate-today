        <p>Some people are less fortunate; life is not kind to all of us. While you might be lucky enough to live a comfortable life, <br> others don’t have a roof over their head or food to put on the table. You won’t be able to <br> help everyone in need, but your gesture, no matter how small, will definitely make a difference</p>

            <p>Helping others is not always about giving them money or material things. Some people just need a shoulder <br> to cry on or some good advice. And you don’t necessarily have to be friends with someone to be there <br> for them. This is simply about being human and caring about other people’s well-being.</p>
